# TRAcalorie

I developed a calorie tracking app using Object-Oriented JavaScript and Bootstrap. The app allows users to set daily calorie limits, input meals and workouts, calculate their caloric impact, and display the results dynamically in the DOM. The data is also saved in local storage for persistent tracking.
